This week, our group members (Kelin Chen, Chang Zhao and Zhuohang Song) met with our advisor Xiaobang Wang in his office and we determined the research direction of our group project.

> The meeting lasted about half an hour, during which our mentor gave us some suggestions and also allowed us to choose our own research path.

After the meeting, the team members had a second internal discussion. After repeated consideration and discussion, we decided to design a **railway-multi-terrain dual-purpose vehicle** as the goal and carry out research activities for the graduation project.
